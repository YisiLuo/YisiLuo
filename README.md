Greetings! I received my bachelor degree in information and computing sciences at School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) supervised by [Prof. Xile Zhao](https://zhaoxile.github.io).

I am currently pursuing the master degree at School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi’an Jiaotong University (XJTU) supervised by [Prof. Deyu Meng](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/dymeng).

My research interests include model-based tensor modeling and unsupervised learning for low-level visual tasks, e.g., inpainting, denoising, and deraining. I serve as a regular reviewer for CVPR, ECCV, and AAAI.
