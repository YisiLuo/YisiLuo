Greetings! I am currently an undergraduate at School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) supervised by [Prof. Xi-Le Zhao](https://zhaoxile.github.io).

I will pursue the master degree at School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi’an Jiaotong University (XJTU) supervised by [Prof. De-Yu Meng](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/dymeng).

My research interests include model-based tensor modeling and unsupervised learning for low-level vision tasks, e.g., inpainting, denoising, and deraining. I serve as a regular reviewer for CVPR 2022 and ECCV 2022.
